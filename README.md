# NTNU_avg_grade_calculator
Calculate the average grade from "Vitnemålsportalen" pdf. Based on NTNU grade rules, from this url: https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/Norsk/FS+-+Beregne+snittkarakter .

## Calculating average grade
First clone the project and run 

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Then download the PDF from Vitnemålsportalen and run 

```python main [path to pdf] ```

## Notes
This will read through every page of the pdf, so If you have grades from multiple universities then you have to separate the pdf's
